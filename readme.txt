azaka is a web system for people in sharehouses.
It does not have a capital letter for aesthetic reasons.
It can cope with:
	bill management,
	internet usage,
	ventrilio server status,
	news,
	and whatever else I think of.

Also it is built to be secure. In theory.

There github. I have a readme. I hope you are happy. -angry fist-

It uses jQuery and ajax. Yay.
