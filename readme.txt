azaka is a web system for people in sharehouses.
It does not have a capital letter for aesthetic reasons.
It can cope with:
	bill management (supporting paypal),
	internet usage (netspace only - but xml can be altered for others),
	ventrilio server status,
	news,
	and whatever else I think of.

Also it is built to be secure. In theory.

There github. I have a readme. I hope you are happy. -angry fist-

It uses jQuery and ajax. Yay.


While I am here, I should dump these somewhere:
*The name 'azaka' and the icon are based off Kokuto Azaka from the Kara no Kyoukai books and movies. (c) Type Moon.
*The loading bar (which I plan to replace) is from ajaxload.info
*The vent module uses the php class found at ventrilo.com/download.php
*jah (the main ajax function) is from http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/staticjah.html
*paypal uses... Pay...Pal...
